# Project Nyx
Project Nyx, the successor to Project 250.

To launch (Spring or Summer) 2018.

Bugs: None that I know of

Todo:
  - Improve image quality
  - Improve/degrade video quality
  - Improve live time
  - Find a way of shutting off wifi automatically (maybe based on whether or not a network is available)
  - Remove extrapolator, I have completed a better version and will upload that in another git repo.
